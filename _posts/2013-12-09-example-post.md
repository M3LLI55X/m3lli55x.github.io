New York City is the most densely populated major city in the United States and more than twice as populous as Los Angeles, the nation's second-largest city. New York City is located at the southern tip of New York State. The city constitutes the geographical and demographic center of both the Northeast megalopolis and the New York metropolitan area, the largest metropolitan area in the U.S. by both population and urban area. With over 20.1 million people in its metropolitan statistical area and 23.5 million in its combined statistical area as of 2020, New York is one of the world's most populous megacities, and over 58 million people live within 250 mi (400 km) of the city.  <sup>[1]</sup> 

New York City is a global cultural, financial, entertainment, and media center with a significant influence on commerce, health care and life sciences, research, technology, education, politics, tourism, dining, art, fashion, and sports. 

Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy, and is sometimes described as the capital of the world.

### INTRODUCTION
Many people love New York City, but nobody likes car accidents. Road safety is by any means a critical issue, and is relevant to everybody's daily life.

The data set used is from the city government's OpenData website, where a lot of useful data sets archived by city government are provided. The NYC motor vehicle collision data set, contains up-to-date collision record ever since July 1st, 2012, and each record shows the date, time, location, the number of injured and/or killed people

### MOTIVATION

How is the data look like on a map? Wherer are  more dangerous/risky regions? 
Can we identify dangerous spots/areas?
What is the trend of total number of collisions? What can we predict for future?
What is the composition ratio of different types of victims (pedestrian, cyclist, motorist) and different levels of severities (no hurt, injured, lethal)?
Was the situation different for different boroughs (5 boroughs of NYC)? What about different? ...

### Interactive Map Tool

To help easily visualize and explore the spatial details of the collision data, a comprehensive and flexible interactive map tool is developed using Leaflet.
it can show heat map, cluster map and position. And we can see which borough has the most frequent collision
